    "AllCanFarm is committed to reducing the carbon footprint of angel farmers and promoting sustainable agriculture. As part of this commitment, the company provides carbon credits to the Angel Farmer for every farm adopted. Carbon credits are a way of measuring and trading carbon emissions reductions. By providing carbon credits to the Angel Farmers, AllCanFarm is incentivizing the adoption of sustainable farming practises that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With carbon credits, AllCanFarm is not only promoting sustainable agriculture but also creating a more equitable and sustainable food system.",

    "Dhur Maati is a marketplace for all the produce from AllCanFarm. It is a vertical of AllCanFarm, which allows the angel farmer to list the crops and fruits produced on the adopted farm to reach urban homes. The concept of Maati is straightforward: deliver pure and unprocessed food directly to consumers' tables. This model works best as it bypasses intermediaries like wholesalers, distributors, and retailers. Maati allows you to earn a reasonable profit without splitting it with middlemen. Additionally, consumers can enjoy farm-fresh produce and have a better connection to the source of their food. Maati focuses on farm scalability and meeting urban demands.",
