    "Dhur Maati is a marketplace for all the produce from AllCanFarm. It is a vertical of AllCanFarm, which allows the angel farmer to list the crops and fruits produced on the adopted farm to reach urban homes. The produce is free of preservatives and unadulterated. The concept of Maati is straightforward: deliver pure and unprocessed food directly to consumers' tables. This model works best as it bypasses intermediaries like wholesalers, distributors, and retailers. Maati allows you to earn a reasonable profit without splitting it with middlemen. Additionally, consumers can enjoy farm-fresh produce and have a better connection to the source of their food. Maati focuses on farm scalability and meeting urban demands.",
